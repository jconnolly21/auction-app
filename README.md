# Fantasy Baseball Auction Assistant

The goal of this project is to create an application that assists a player when drafting in a fantasy baseball auction by performing a combination of useful tasks:

1. Keep track of which players have been drafted, which opposing teams drafted them, and at what price.
2. Visualize remaining players in the auction pool, and their projections / value.
3. Visualize team totals in the 10 ROTO categories.
5. Assemble a team / ensure the players drafted can combined into a legal roster.

The flexibility in a web application should allow further customization than what has been available through traditional spreadsheet tools. 

## TODO: 
- Performance improvements (gets slower as more players are drafted).
- Enable multi-league support, which will require:
	1. Blah 1
	2. Blah 2
- Other stuff
