#Fantasy Baseball Auction Assistant

The goal of this project is to create an application that assists a player when drafting in a fantasy baseball auction by performing a combination of useful tasks:

1. Keep track of which players have been drafted, which opposing teams drafted them, and at what price.
2. Recalculate auction values for players on the fly (using a predetermined scheme).
3. Visualize team totals in the 10 ROTO categories.
4. Allow fuzzy searching for player names (because I'm dumb).

The flexibility in a web application should allow further customization than what has been available through traditional spreadsheet tools.
